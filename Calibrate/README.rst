Calibrate
=========

The code here is used to calibrate a touchscreen on a TFT screen.

Use it by running the program and repeatedly running the pen around
especially into the screen corners and edges.  The program will write
a fragment of code to the serial terminal that you must paste into
touchscreen code.
