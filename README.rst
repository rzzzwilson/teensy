teensy
======

A place for code I've written for the
`teensy 3.1 <https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy31.html>`_ and 
`teensy 3.2 <https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html>`_ 
microcontrollers.

At first, this is just *paddling around, experimental* code using the
Arduino IDE and `teensyduino <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html>`_
patch to handle the teensy system.  Real teensy projects are elsewhere,
such as the `DigitalVFO project <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/DigitalVFO>`_.

Eventually I want to move to more UNIX-like 'make' system, but I can't
get that working with arduino-1.6.5-r5 yet.

The Arduino build system wants it's own filetypes - won't open and read a \*.c
file!  I have to cut and paste the code into the IDE!!  And I also have to cut
and paste changed code _back_ into the source code file as the IDE won't let me
save *anywhere* in the filesystem but only to a few selected places!!!  GRRRRR.

One way around this is to fiddle with directories and code names.  For instance,
if we have a program **test.c** that we want to run in the Arduino IDE then we
can create a subdirectory called **test** and copy **test.c** into it with a name
change to **test.ino**.  The Arduino IDE will now open the code and compile it.
If you change the code in the IDE then you must copy **test/test.ino** back to 
**test.c**.  Clumsy.

Must switch to a command line environment as soon as possible.
