teensy
======

A place for code I've written for the
`teensy <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html>`_ microcontroller.

At first, this is just *paddling around, experimental* code using the
Arduino IDE and `teensyduino <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html>`_
patch to handle the teensy 3.1 system.

Eventually I want to move to more UNIX-like 'make' system, but I can't
get that working with arduino-1.6.5-r5 yet.
