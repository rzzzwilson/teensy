Blink
=====

The teensy `tutorials <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html>`_ start
with a 'blink' example.  This is a very simple *hello world!* example that
blinks the on-board LED.

**blink.c** is the original teensy program, one second on, on second off.

**blink_double.c** blinks the LED twice rapidly with a one second repeat time.
